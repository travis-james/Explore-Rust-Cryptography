*** A note about types ***
In Go, byte is an alias for uint8. Go takes bytes as kind of whatever. -5 or 5 doesn't matter, it's a byte.
Rust isn't so free wheeling. There is no "byte" type. It's u8. And that's a STRICT u8, no negatives.

cargo new --bin blah
cargo new --lib blah

-p says what package to run.
echo "hello" | cargo run -p encipher -- --key 5
echo "mjqqt" | cargo run -p decipher -- --key 5

The Cargo.toml at the base directory is a workspace manifest, not a crate manifest. The members are relative paths.
