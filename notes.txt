*** A note about types ***
In Go, byte is an alias for uint8. Go takes bytes as kind of whatever. -5 or 5 doesn't matter, it's a byte.
Rust isn't so free wheeling. There is no "byte" type. It's u8. And that's a STRICT u8, no negatives.

cargo new  blah --bin // doing this for commands.
cargo new blah --lib 

-p says what package to run.
echo "hello" | cargo run -p encipher -- --key 5
echo "mjqqt" | cargo run -p decipher -- --key 5

The Cargo.toml at the base directory is a workspace manifest, not a crate manifest. The members are relative paths.

cargo run -p encipher -- --key 7 < tiger.txt > tiger.bin
cargo run -p crack -- --crib 'The tiger' < tiger.bin | iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-8

cargo run -p encipher -- --key 99 < devil.png > devil.bin
cargo run -p crack -- --crib $(printf '\x89PNG') <devil.bin >plain.png

Clap wants CLI input to be UTF8 strings then converts, it won't accept bytes even if the flag type isn't string.
  Running `target/debug/crack --crib 'ï¿½PNG'`
